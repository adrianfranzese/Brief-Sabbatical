  <h4>Yesterday, 1:42PM</h4>
  <h3>How would you describe your personal practice?</h3>
  <p>I see my practice less as being limited to a specific medium (say, typography or publication design) and more a kind of idea that can be carried across whatever process I’m working on. I’d try to describe my personal practice as being primarily concerned with type and imagery, specifically exploring how typography can become more imagistic and vise-versa.</p>
  <h3>That sounds pretty wanky, just give it to me straight (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd4FfNpYxF0&amp;t=59s">like a pear cider that’s made from 100% pears</a>)</h3>
  <p>Fair enough, but just so you know all this art-speak is just a blatant attempt to come off as if I know what I&#39;m talking about here. I think with the artefact I made you can see a bit of this idea coming through, the way the lettering is more interesting as something to be looked at rather than, ya know, be read and understood. Same with the symbols I&#39;ve used, they&#39;re designed to be just as much a part of the language as the font is.</p>
  <h3>Hmm ok I&#39;m starting to see it now, but what&#39;s the use of all that? Aren&#39;t texts read and images looked at for a reason?</h3>
  <p>I mean that seems to be the logical idea but it betrays the fact that we&#39;re looking at text and reading images all the time, it&#39;s just so subconscious that we don&#39;t even realise we do it. Things are always layered with <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/qinRf1Z2zsg?t=358">various extra meanings and values</a>, embedded in the way they&#39;re presented. So I guess what I&#39;m trying to do isn&#39;t new or even very interesting, but I want to try and push at this idea, see where it begins to break.</p>
  <h3>Sure, I think I follow.</h3>
  <p>Don&#39;t worry, I only half get it myself.</p>
  <h3>Is that a problem, not really knowing what it is for sure?</h3>
  <p>...No I don&#39;t think so. <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/UMKIlT-C1w4?t=117">I mean I rarely have a firm grasp on whatever it is I&#39;m doing</a> (whether its writing an essay or driving a car) and it seems to have worked out for me so far. I can be open to exploring things a bit more this way I think, if I settle on something too soon I find it too easy to just carry down the road I&#39;m already on. Rather than entertain the notion that the road I&#39;m off is leading off a sheer cliff.</p>
  <h3>Where would you like to go next with your personal practice?</h3>
  <p>I know I&#39;d like to start moving beyond publication design, books and zines and all that, not because I&#39;m no longer interested in them (I am) but because I feel like I haven&#39;t really explored much else. Like I&#39;m still stuck automatically seeing things in terms of pages and binding and Indesign layouts. I&#39;m very interested in <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/uFfq2zblGXw">films and video</a>, so I&#39;d like to experiment with how graphic design would work with that. I mean there&#39;s a bit of a similarity between pages and frames, in a vague way.</p>
  <h3>How is that going to relate to your thing about text and images?</h3>
  <p>I&#39;m not really sure.</p>
  <h3>Are you clear on anything?</h3>
  <p>No not really, I&#39;m still not too clear on what an SKO is, and I still struggle succinctly explaining what my project is about. But movies are a good example of how we read into images, how what and how things are presented tell us just as much if not more than what is said (Who knows, maybe that cinema studies course will come in handy for once?).</p>
  <h3>Anything else you&#39;d like to try next?</h3>
  <p>I mean there&#39;s plenty of stuff, but I&#39;m not very good about planning things. I barely have enough foresight to know what I&#39;m doing a week from today so anything longer-term than that is super abstract for me.</p>
  <h3>You keep rambling but you&#39;re not actually saying anything.</h3>
  <p>Yeah look at this point I&#39;m just trying to reach the word-count. Digital media could be fun to try out, but I worry that a lot of the time it just ends up being a <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/KuTSAeFhdZU">novelty</a>, like oh yeah we&#39;ll stick a QR code on it and that&#39;s the future. Everything we do ends up being mediated by these digital forms but I kind of feel like what I&#39;m making could just as easily be shown as a book. Back to square one again. Maybe my <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/sXJ8tKRlW3E?t=109">message</a> has to change?</p>

  <h4>Today, 3:25AM</h4>
  <h3>What else interests you then?</h3>
  <p>Lots of stuff. Sometimes design doesn&#39;t interest me at all (I&#39;m half joking of course, it&#39;s the only thing I can do). Things like art, music, film all interest me obviously, they all kind of feed into each other it&#39;s not much more complicated than that. But the world outside of design is alright too. Politics and media are interesting in the way they&#39;re &#39;designed&#39;, but we don&#39;t always think of them like that.</p>
  <h3>What key lessons have you learnt through exploring your personal practice?</h3>
  <p>I think that my big take-away is that there is a lot of value in confusion and not taking everything too seriously. A lot of strange but funny stuff gets censored when you take yourself too seriously. <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/atn22-bmTPU?t=74">Don&#39;t be solemn.</a> I also learnt to get a bit more comfortable with being uncomfortable, if something felt wrong then there was a good chance that I was doing something new (to me at least), and that was a cool feeling.</p>
  <h3>Nothing you&#39;ve said so far is particularly insightful, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/jB4xlYKAVCQ?t=2578">it&#39;s like you just pasted together these bits and pieces from your &quot;authoritative sources.&quot; I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m beginning to suspect there&#39;s nothing really in there.</a></h3>
  <p>I mean I think you&#39;re right, like I said before I think people do this all the time without realising it. So to be totally honest I don&#39;t quite know what I&#39;m trying to add to the discussion that hasn&#39;t already been said or done by someone else, and they&#39;ve probably done it better too. But I&#39;ve got to fill my time up with something don&#39;t I?</p>
  <h3>I suppose so, but shouldn&#39;t you try directing your efforts to something that isn&#39;t as well-tread? Something new?</h3>
  <p>Possibly, but I don&#39;t really see much harm in what I&#39;m doing. If I get too bogged down trying to create something new or &#39;worthy&#39; then I&#39;m not going to make anything at all. <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/CGcWTIWYDMQ?t=97">Something is better than nothing</a> isn&#39;t it?</p>
  <h3>Why is your personal practice important to you?</h3>
  <p>I don&#39;t really know.</p>
  <h3>Is it because it appears to link everything you do together in a fairly cohesive way without applying too much conscious effort, so that you can justify whatever useless thing you do as fitting into your larger &#39;practice&#39;, that way you can come across as if you know what you&#39;re doing?</h3>
  <p>Yeah, probably.</p>
