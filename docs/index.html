    <h3>So what am I looking at?</h3>
    <p>This is my SKO, it's a website because I told myself that I didn't want to make a book for my project but I made one anyway, so this is the opposite of that.</p>
    <h3>What's with the chat bubbles?</h3>
    <p>I started writing this as an interview with myself (That sounds a bit sad actually, like I couldn't convince anyone else to interview me so I was forced to do it myself. That didn't happen), and this format makes sense for a dialogue.</p>
    <h3>A bit self-indulgent no?</h3>
    <p>Yeah I reckon, but I also get to call myself out on my own bullshit, which is pretty fun.</p>
    <h3>Fair call. What are the other pages above for?</h3>
    <p>The second one is the actual interview, and the third lets you ask me a question which then comes up on my phone. I might get around to answering it but I haven't thought that far ahead yet.</p>
